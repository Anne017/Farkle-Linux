# Farkle

A Linux frontend to allow playing the Farkle dice game with the [Farkle library](https://github.com/Arc676/Farkle)

Full gameplay details and rules can be found in the README in that repository.

# Compilation

This version of Farkle was developed using `clickable`. The repository includes 64 and 32 bit versions of the Farkle library in `plugins/FarkleBackend/lib`. In order to compile the Farkle frontend, you will need to rename the appropriate library to `libfarkle.a` (or create a symbolic link or otherwise make the correct library available under this name).
